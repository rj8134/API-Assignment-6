    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Increased Interoperability: API solutions enable different software systems to communicate with each other, regardless of their programming language or platform. This enhances the interoperability between systems, allowing for the exchange of data and functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improved Efficiency: API driven infrastructures enable developers to reuse code and functionality from existing software systems, saving time and reducing the amount of code that needs to be written from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Better User Experience: APIs can enable third-party developers to create applications that integrate with existing software systems, providing a better user experience and increased functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Increased Flexibility: APIs provide developers with greater flexibility, enabling them to choose the best programming languages and frameworks for their needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "New Revenue Streams: APIs can enable companies to create new revenue streams by providing third-party developers with access to their software systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "Security Concerns: API infrastructures can be vulnerable to security breaches, such as SQL injection attacks and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, making it crucial to implement security measures to protect against these threats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity: APIs can be complex, requiring a significant amount of development effort to implement and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compatibility Issues: APIs can have compatibility issues between different versions of the same software system or between different systems, which can lead to errors and system failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependency on Third-Party Developers: APIs rely on third-party developers to create applications that integrate with the software system. This can create dependencies that are outside of the control of the company that owns the software system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Governance and Management: APIs require proper governance and management to ensure they are being used correctly and consistently across different applications and systems."

    "REST is the abbreviation of Representational State Transfer, a phrase coined in the year 2000 by Mr. Roy Fielding. It is a structural design approach for crafting loosely attached applications using HTTP, often implemented in the growth of web services. REST web services do not impose any rules concerning how it needs to be applied in practice at a low level; it only holds the high-level design guiding principles and leaves it to the developer to think about the implementation.\n",
    "In this architecture, a REST server provides connectivity to resources, which helps with client access as well as updating resources. In this, the resources are recognized by the URIs / Global IDs. REST API creates a variety of outputs to represent a resource, such as JSON - which is very popular among them all, text, XML formats. REST architecture-oriented web services are termed as RESTful web services.\n",

    "Method\t                   Description\n",
    "GET\t            This method helps in offering read-only access for the resources.\n",
    "POST\t        This method is implemented for creating a new resource.\n",
    "DELETE\t        This method is implemented for removing a resource.\n",
    "PUT\t            This method is implemented for updating an existing resource or creating                 a fresh one.\n",

    "The World Wide Web may be regarded as a REST-based architecture. A RESTful architecture is built on the client-server paradigm, with stateless, cacheable communication between clients and servers. It’s important to note that REST is neither technology nor a standard but an architectural alternative to traditional RPC and SOAP. REST is a software architectural approach for creating distributed applications that can communicate via HTTP."

It works on top of application layer protocols like HTML and SMTP for notations and transmission.
